# Allergen
This is our CS246 Team Project.

#**The Apps purpose**:  
To help all ages of people with food allergies or specific diets. This would help in restaurants and any kind of food product from the store anywhere from food to drinks. As far as the Restaurant program works is this:  
#**Step one**:  
User would download app.  
#**Step two**:  
User would give basic information like Username, email address, age, birthday, etc.  
#**Step three**:  
User would be taken to a separate page where they would choose from a list of possible allergies. (We could get the top allergies\ ingredients in food off different websites or any source we can find.) There they would choose which allergies they have or just foods they don't like or possible Diets they are on (Paleo Diet). Then they would hit a submit button.  
#**Step 4**:  
After that they would be brought to the home page. Where in the top right there would be a menu button for them to either sign out or go to their account to be able to edit what they had previously made.(These are the beginning steps for when they first get an account)  
#**The Audience**:  
Absolutely anyone. The beauty of this app is that not only is it for personal use it can be used forothers that can't even operate a phone (As long as they have someone close to them that can like a child) In the top right of the home screen will be an arrow facing down where if you click on it it will give you the option to add a person to your account or just choose a person you've previously registered. As well as having a option to select all. This is for families that want to go out to eat but each family member has separate allergies. For example, lil jimmy is allergic to pepperoni and papa john is allergic to olives. So if they went to Pizza Hut and wanted to split something between the family then Meat lovers and Supreme pizza would not be options for this family. (Basic example would be more in depth). For personal use we could customize it where when they click on a restaurant it gives them a personalized menu or highlights things that they cannot eat.
